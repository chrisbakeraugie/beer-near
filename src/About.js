      brewery to you.</h5>
      <p>Picture this. After a year of lounging inside and working from home, local businesses are opening up their taprooms and breweries, and they&apos;re looking for customer support. And you&apos;re an upstanding citizen who happens to need a beer absolutely right now.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>But wait!</strong> Searching &ldquo;Beer&ldquo; online gives too many results, and you just want breweries and taprooms.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Well, panic no longer. Beer Near will show you the nearest breweries to you, using your current location or any address you choose.
